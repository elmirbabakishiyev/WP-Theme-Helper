# WP Theme Helper
Theme Helper class for WordPress theme developers

If you are developing WordPress Themes, after some time you will realize that remembering 
WordPress actions and filters is not easy and this makes developemnt process slow.For this purpose I made a class that 
you can extend and can easly add register menu, add theme support, add custom taxonomy and 
custom taxonomy fields and etc.

I will keep adding new functions to this class.

Wiki page will include all function descriptions and usages.
